# Meta: Missing or inaccurate video alternative

## WCAG Level

Level A

## Sub-issues

* [Linked list of sub-issues]

## Description

When an alternative is not provided for video-only content, like a clip from a silent movie, people who cannot see the video will find it difficult or impossible to understand.

## User impact

Without a text description of the video-only content, or an equivalent audio recording, someone who is blind or who has low vision will not be able to understand the video.

## General solution

Provide a text description or equivalent audio recording for all video-only content, and make sure it is an accurate reflection of the original content.

Refer to the related sub-issues identified in this ticket for specific implementation guidance.
