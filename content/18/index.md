# Missing or inaccurate audio transcript

## WCAG Level

Level A

## Sub-issues

* [Linked list of sub-issues]

## Description

When a transcript is not provided for audio-only content, like a song or a recording of a radio broadcast, people who cannot hear the audio will find it difficult or impossible to understand.

A transcript is a text alternative to the audio content. Typically it includes the words spoken or sung in the audio content, plus descriptions of other important sounds. It may also contain a general description of the audio content - the genre of music or the style of the presenter for example.

## User impact

Without an accurate transcript that contains the words being spoken or sung, and descriptions of other important things like sound-effects, someone who is deaf or hard or hearing will not be able to understand the audio content.

Transcripts may also be useful to people in noisy environments where the ambient noise makes it hard to hear audio content, and to people in quiet environments where turning up the volume may disturb other people nearby.

## General solution

Provide a text transcript for all audio-only content, and make sure that the dialogue and other important sounds are accurately represented.

You must apply this solution to all instances of the issue identified within the representative sample, and then apply it to all other instances of the same issue identified throughout the rest of the website.

## Test procedure(s)

Use these steps to confirm that the solution has been correctly applied to issues identified within the representative sample, and to test the rest of the website for instances of the same issue.

1. Check that a text transcript is available for all audio-only content that contains words or other important sounds
2. Check that the transcript is an accurate representation of the words and that other important sounds are accurately described

### Definition of done

Complete all of these tasks before closing this issue or indicating it is ready for retest:

* All issues/sub-issues identified within the representative sample have been resolved
* The rest of the website has been tested for the same type of issue
* All issues identified throughout the rest of the website have been resolved or filed as new issues
