# Meta: Missing or inaccurate captions for prerecorded content

## WCAG Level

Level A

## Sub-issues

* [Linked list of sub-issues]

## Description

When captions are not available for video/multimedia content that has an audio track, people who cannot hear the audio will find it difficult or impossible to understand the content.

Captions are a text alternative to the audio content of a video or multimedia presentation, synchronised with the original audio track. Typically captions contain the dialogue being spoken (including who is speaking), plus descriptions of other important sounds.

## User impact

Without accurate captions someone who is deaf or hard of hearing will find it difficult or impossible to understand the video or multimedia content, particularly if it contains spoken dialogue.

Captions are also useful to people in noisy environments where the ambient noise makes it hard to hear audio content, and to people in quiet environments where turning up the volume may disturb other people nearby.

## General solution

Provide synchronised captions for each video/multimedia content that has meaningful audio (audio that conveys information, rather than just being "decorative", like instrumental mood music or similar), and make sure that the dialogue and all important sound-effects are included.

Closed captions (CC) are the recommended way to provide captions. These are captions that can be displayed on demand, usually by activating a control in the media player interface. Open captions are added directly to the video or multimedia content itself and are displayed in all circumstances. While open captions are an acceptable method of meeting this requirement, it is recommended that closed captions are provided, as they offer greater flexibility and the opportunity to be customised to suit the needs of the viewer.

## Test procedure(s)

Use these steps to confirm that the solution has been correctly applied to issues identified within the representative sample, and to test the rest of the website for instances of the same issue.

1. Check that captions are available for all videos/multimedia content with meaningful audio content that contains spoken dialogue and sound-effects
2. Check that the captions are an accurate representation of the spoken dialogue and sound-effects in the audio content

### Definition of done

Complete all of these tasks before closing this issue or indicating it is ready for retest:

* All issues/sub-issues identified within the representative sample have been resolved
* The rest of the website has been tested for the same type of issue
* All issues identified throughout the rest of the website have been resolved or filed as new issues
